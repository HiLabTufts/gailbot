\f0\fs24 \cf0 Okay \
What\'92d you wanna talk about \
Well this is like prison you know the things they have in movies \

It looks like a mirror\
It's kinda creepy \
It\'92s weird\
Um\
I do have math homework today  \
Well it\'92s due today oh I have this really hard problem set  that I have no idea how to do and I\'92ve asked everybody I know who's good at math and that they can't do it either and so then Michelle and I were gonna go to office hours today which is why I told you I couldn\'92t come to breakfast \
And then the teacher was like not there and very and like we couldn\'92t find her but it\'92s due at six o'clock tonight so after this
\f1  
\f0 Yeah I have no idea how to do it and googling it didn't help    \
How many more problems do you have to do  \
Yeah I started writing my like three thousand word essay  \
For English and I wrote a thousand words and realized that I have nothing else to say \
Oh that's problematic\
What um what are you writing about \
We had to choose two op-eds about anything we wanted so I chose\
Is this
\f1  
\f0 English one  \
Yeah so I chose one it was actually mine were about the U. N. climate report some one was about um how \
Oh so it's like your mom again  \
Wouldn\'92t you know one was like \
Uh-huh\
Thats like a conflicting argument so where did you fall \
I ju-can't give an opinion it's like a writing about the arguments like just I have to write about which argument is presented better \
So which one is presented better   \
The one that we might as well try  \
I might be a little biased\
Optimis- yeah probably\
Oh\
That's good so it's definitely arguable \
 I haveto do oh go ahead  \
But I was just gonna say I'm just really bad at writing essays so \
you\'92re a third done how many pages is three thousand words  \
So like nine ten\
It\'92s- it\'92s a long essay \
It sucks  \
We have to do\
And we only
\f1  
\f0 had two days to read it was assigned Monday night\
Oh really
\f1  
\f0 it's due Wednesday \
Well a rough draft is due Wednesday  \

Yes and I probably won't finish it like I'm not gonna be ableto do it tonight \
Oh that's true who are the red sox playing\
Dodgers\
Dodgers where are the Dodgers from  \
I think  I hope that I'm not gonna get made fun of for getting that wrong  \
Is your dad is your dad rooting the red Sox \
ish like none of us are like really into the Red Sox but it's like kind of like a weird like emotional attachment like I don't really watch them that much but I feel very like it's like my childhood kind of like I was very into that when I was a kid  \
What changed \
really fiddling you should be like good at it because of your job \
Yeah I I need to like have something to play with my  \
I play with like when I have a
\f1  
\f0 they're doing the like assigning thing I was playing with the pen \
Oh I have my keys I could just like trill that around \
It'd mess up the microphone \
I'd probably hit it  \
Yeah
\f1  
\f0 the Red Sox how you\'92d no longer like them \
Oh no I still like them I just don't watch them as much  \
Hm \
But it's like a ver- it's like the psych thing that we're that like emotionally like \
Psych thing \
Conditioned to it's like the same thing with the Yankees like\
Oh cuz you're
\f1  
\f0 so mean to Frankie about it \
I'm not so mean she just deserves it because they're evil  \
Frankie's
\f1  
\f0 a hard core fan  \
You- you're just biased   \
The nat's are really good  \
The what  \

She was like walking around and she was like you're in my seat you're in fifteen \
Then\
But it wasn't on you  \
It wasn't on me  \
Well she spilled beer on somebody it's sticky and gross\
But that'd been worse
\f1  
\f0 if it was on you \
Was it weird
\f1  
\f0 with Eli \
What do you mean weird with Eli \
Cuz he's like I don't know for like whenever we'd sit with him during breakfast he never talks much so I don't know  \
Oh no no he's nice I like him \
Oh \
How's your p- new printer \
I haven't used it at all yet  \
No \
And his
\f1  
\f0 yeah and he's explained it twice and I still don't get it  \
It's just confusing he's like you have to find the I. P. address and then pair it to your computer I'm like what \
Okay I can do it for you \
Okay I also can't get into my mailbox to get my absentee ballot like the like turning thing I ca-I like do the code and then it doesn't open \
Yeah you have to look at the camera \
No I was on TV last year and they told me like you don't look at the camera but I couldn't help but look at the camera  \
Why were you on TV  \
We were like I my team we did some practice and then so you have practice for like eight minutes before you run through your program for awhile \
And then they  you're still sick  \
I'm not sick anymore I just have a cough \
One and the same but we're like finished practice iceand then like this TV woman like stop[ed me as I was getting off the ice and was like excuse me can I talk to you for a moment and I was like oh I thought I did something wrong  and then they just asked me a bunch of questions about skating and like what it meant to be on the team and everything  \
What'd you say \
I'm gonna google the video it's gonna be

\f1 \uc0\u8969 
\f0  sending this to me  \
And then they're like what what's wrong and then they pulled it up together and watched it  \
It was very embarrassing \

Which was\
It wasn't like bad quotes for this it's just weird out this like  Matthew said  and I was like that's like nice and well reported but like \
So they changed your own words\
I didn't say that\
What did they what did you just actually say in person I don't know I didn't really say a lot I was very uncomfortable being like interviewed and recorded  \
It was like very stressful because they tried to like they're trying to get me to  say like \
Hm \
Cuz it could also like haunt you later like\
Yeah I don't want something to  like it was like one I don't wanna\
	 be mean but also I don't wanna like something st- like Matthew said like\
Uh huh\
It could be like grown ups have you seen grownups \
Okay
\f1  
\f0 it's like the scene where they have the basketball team and then they're all like in their forties they all come out of the () that could be a tennis game he had been talking poorly of them
\f1 \uc0\u8969 
\f0   \
Oh \
Well what did they say why were they mean \
I can't remember I just remember not liking them \
Oh well \
Who knows \
There's a kid on the tennis club tennis team here who's on the rival team mine in highschool  \
And he was like the one kid that I didn't hate for the rest of were just like so meanand that was kind of awful \
Who was um cuz you went to Hanover high school or something  \
It was Bedford \
Is that far or close  \
Sorry it's really bothering me \
Um when I went to go tour Dartmouth I went to the King Arthur flour  \
That's where I had my tufts interview\
it was at is that place oh cuz there's like a little cafe in there \
I thought it was really cool cuz I really like baking and I was like this is so cool  \
It's cool yeah I didn't go there as much though  \
Yeah I wish I went there more wait where'd you stay in Hanover \
Hanover inn  \
No I know that's where everybody else stayed there's like a brand new hotel it's like\
Six South Street \
Was it in Hanover or was okay\
Yeah no it was
\f1 \uc0\u8971 
\f0 \
We got there at like eleven o'clock at night though so I was really grumpy and miserable  like I was I was hangry and so I was really mad at my mom I was like I hate traveling like why are you doing this and they went to some pizza place  \
Ermeto's \
they had a f- I got free pizza there couple of times  \
What did you do \
Like a whole piece of like it was a p-how bigger was it \
Like it was like a large pie that I sh-ared with my friends \
Well I was with my friends \
Oh  \
Um I'm going to dinner with Cameron on Friday\
I've alright picked out everything I want \
Wait that's not
\f1  
\f0 the place that we just passed was it \
No no it's somewhere in like you know there's a north end \
I don't know Boston at all but sure  \
And there's like the south and then there's like it's not the south end but it's still on the water it's called seaport  \
Southie \
Ok you get off at Haymarket and it's like a mile long walk\
Eh okay well but you're going there for dinner \
Uh huh \
What kind of food is it  \
Italian cuz Tuscan  but it's really really good like I've been looking at the things all day which has made me really hungry and then for lunch today I had leftover pesto pasta from the ben koto place I had a with my parents\
I feel like
\f1  
\f0 going for Italian food while being vegetarian kinda sucks  \
No it's just cheese and pasta and carbs \
Yeah but there's no meat like you need like protein in there \
No you doesn't cheese cheese is protein  \
They can't get the is there
\f1  
\f0 a lot of protein in cheese \
There's a reasonable amount  I don't know what would you eat if you're a vegetarian  \
I wouldn't be vegetarian I don't know  except I got guilted into doing a meatless dinner couple nights ago  \
Oh by Toby \
No no I just walked in and they had like the eco reps and they're like would you like to commit to being vegan for th-dinner or like being going meatless for tonight  and I was like I don't really want to and they're like oh just do it to save the environment and I was like \
Which dinning hall were you at \
And I'm very bad at saying no to people \
Um Michelle hasthe same problem  \
Yeah\
Yeah I just like if someone like \
Wait does this hurt your ear sorry  \
it should it doesn't\
It's been bothering my ear  \
maybe you have weird ears  \
Oh  \
I was told that when I got my cartilage piercing \
Um yea wait so which dining hall was it \
What day was de- what day did you go  \
and then they guilt me into it \
Well what did you eat \
I ate pasta \
that's like healthy and good food I mean it's not at all healthy\
Not really though\
No it's not healthy I need like it's this is just carbs \
Yeah you-so you eat a salad \
Yeah but that's a lot of effort because then you have to like make it and and then like just like I wanted to feel to like scoop up \
the um \
And beef \
They make a vegetarian version that's just over on the side \
but it's tofu  it's weird  \
Tofu's good I had really good tofu last time\
It's not good I don't like tofu
\f1  
\f0 \
Oh well that's irrelevant  \
Is there anything in tofu does it have any nutritional value  \
Yeah no it's soy beans it's full of protein  \
well yeah   \
that's the whole point \
The more you know \
Why would you eat something that like has nothing in it  \
I don't know you're vegetarian you're weird  \
You do all
\f1  
\f0 kinds
\f1  
\f0 of weird things  \
I do not\
You don't eat  \
you just eat vegetables  \
And fish I'll eat fish  \
Oh so you're a pescatarian \
Oh ok  \
But people don't know what pescatarian means  \
Who doesn't know what a pescatarian is \
And they're like oh what is that and they go do you eat chicken and I was like no I don't and so then I just say vegetarian and then tell people later \
So rude \
Yeah do you wanna hear something funny \
Um so you know how what happened to Michelle at Harvard \
She was talking to somebody on our floor today \
you're just a mess\
Um she was talking to somebody on our floor oh you can't even hear me \
Wait I think you're \
Okay I can I can't help you but you're doing it wrong \
Should I just\
It's
\f1  
\f0 it's supposed to like get hooked over your ear here\
No \
Like that \
No I think it goes \
see how far it is  \
It goes the other way  \
No yeah mine must go the other way hold on \
Anyway so m-
\f1 \

\f0 This part goes like  \
Like that \
Sure  \
I keep feeling weird like like it's a video of me embarrassing myself \
This is kind of fine its
\f1  
\f0 but to you to at some point of that  \
Well I can't hear you what \
Oh well I can't even hear and so it's not fair\
Yeah
\f1  
\f0 Well that it was still funny  \
Okay anyway somebody tried to set up with Michelle with somebody she already knew who she is like not at all into he's just like really \
Hummer\
Um-ph \
Do we have the same this is so weird we have the same (0.4) \
this the \
this room is \
I think the room
\f1 \

\f0 No yep they're mirrors of each other  \
I know it's just really weird they're like per- yeah the whole mirror thing it's weird \
Well the tree's aren't perfectly even \
Well they're not perfect but that's pretty close to perfect \
Okay\
It's just very uncomfortable\
Like it would b an art piece maybe  \
It was not like a psychology study it's like an art piece
\f1 \uc0\u8969 
\f0 \
So \
Um \
What else should we talk about \
Oh are you going out on Thursday night for halloween \
I told you we have my friend's surprise birthday party\
Oh that
\f1  
\f0 is true that's true\
They've actually like is it like a real party is it a French party \
I'm\
yeah and then we're doing that but I don- I mean we'll probably do some I don't know I need to find a costume because my co-costumes are required for the for \
It's required just go as yourself go- no go as your brother \
You're so creative  \
you were being uncreative today on the walk over  \
What do you mean I was being uncreative  \
I'm gonna buy random clothes and say I'm that guy from that movie you know\
No it's not nobody's gonna get it \
I'll I'll
\f1  
\f0 think it's funny \
You shou-\
There is somebody at my school and from high school she did like you know those paintings of like the pop art type of thing  like it's very angular drawings and there's like  \
I'll show you a photo later but
\f1 v
\f0 she like painted it on her face  \
And it was actually very very cool and impressive\
see I don't wanna do anything that requires effort \
Oh well that's your problem
\f1  
\f0  \
I just wanna
\f1  
\f0 buy clothes that match a costume  \
Oh
\f1  
\f0 maybe you should wear the unicorn onesie \
Yeah I wonder who yeah it's actually a good idea I'll do that  \
You're welcome Thursday night I think I'm gonna go out
\f1  
\f0 \
So that's gonna
\f1  
\f0 be a weird first impression to people that I don't know but \
It's a costume you can't go wrong on Halloween  \
You really can't \
Cameron's frat is not having any open parties this weekend \
But can't you still go  \
No cuz it's like he's not a \
he's a pledge so he doesn't have like control over it \
so I'll be going to like I think I'm gonna go to my first Tufts frat party
\f1  
\f0 \
Which is exciting  \
we're gonna go to the theta delta chi one probably \
Theta delta chi \
I saw
\f1  
\f0 two that I was like saw on Facebook  \
s-s
\f1  
\f0 \
I think it's like XL or something like that\
it's like the howl at the moon \
maybe yeah\
It's one of
\f1  
\f0 those  \
Oh there's another one on Saturday now \
but I think I'd
\f1  
\f0 wanna do it cuz I hang out with Cameron cuz he has frat stuff \
Oh wait what did you I thought you just said\
Cuz I have dinner \
But that's like a late dinner \
but I think Grace Megan Frankie Michelle and I we're all gonna do a group costume \
with the rainbow like we'd each be a color of the rainbow cuz there's like five of us  \
It's very five year old but  \
They didn't like that idea 
\f1 \

\f0 they all wanna go\
They wanna go thrift shopping \
No there probably's one at Davis \
There's probably one at Davis  \
Oh is that actually a good will store \
I thought
\f1  
\f0 it was just like a-another thrift store  \
There's like three in Davis  \
oh \
I didn't even know \
I figured out their colors \
and one that's cool \
so you don't like\
You know the p- like not the point of thrift stores    \
And there's one that's okay \
'll go cheap but Frankie really wanted to do hippies \
Cuz Frankie wants to buy a pair of bell bottom jeans \
I don't think I give off a hippie vibe (0.6) so \
Eh \
So we'll see it'll happen \
You could do that \
Another good idea was we could all go as animals because Megan really wanted to be (0.5) umm a lobster with her boyfriend but he's going home\
Wait it- okay  \
Megan's
\f1 \

\f0 The
\f1 -
\f0  I know \
so it's like oh let's all be animals cuz I have like a good dog outfit and Megan could be her lobster and someone was like oh yeah \
and they're like wait Megan's like I can't be a lobster cuz you'll all be like normal animals \
No tha- lobster's cool  \
Yeah and then my idea got shot out the window\
she should be a lobster \
Well that was a shame  \
someone told me I should be a seagull \
what would you do \
I really like that idea\
who said that  \
DJ that's really creative on DJ's part \
Oh I saw him on Friday night\
and he was just walking around it's like hi dj \
it's like the like like the nicest little wave possible he was like  \
He's such
\f1  
\f0 a \
he's
\f1  
\f0 he got ordained as a minister \
I   \
And married me and this other guy at breakfast \
it was happening \
and then he's like \
well I didn't sign anything like \
I don't think you have \
do you have to sign you do\
not actually a thing  \
Next time run into DJ \
Can you just sign this for me like I need your signature \
and he's gonna \
Uh  \
How did DJ get ordained  \
just do it online \
he just like put in his name  \
But it has like it could be fake
\f1 \uc0\u8969 
\f0 \
It has to be fake  \
Do you know that happened in ho- oh you should be the guy from how I met your mother  \
Barnie  \
No Jason Segal \
Marshall you should be Marshall \
Oh I thought you talking bout he was the one who got ordained and I think  \
Actually\
No he did yeah that's also why I was thinking about it \
or you could be um Ted you look like a Ted \
Is that a compliment or an insult \
You just
\f1  
\f0 have brown hair so  \
You're not as tall as Marshall \
Fair yeah \
But it's I think a seagull's really creative \
Well so you're just making fun of my nose \
and then you'll need to wear white\
you could wear duck boots so it's like duck
\f1  
\f0  \
I don't
\f1  
\f0 have duck boots \
Oh I would give you mine but you- the probably don't fit \
Maybe I don't know \
I'm sure one of your fr-friends does \
Um\
It's four ten I don't know how long we've been here \
I should've checked that \
I thought we're getting light refreshments  \
Oh I know at the the one thing it said hot refreshments \
And then there's snacks in the other room \
it also does really good pen \
so you should take the the pen case \
Do we get them  \
they're really have pens \
and they have a store for them in Boston  \
You have pens for your birthday\
No but they're really nice pens \
they're point five um \
Like thickness and the they're high quality \
So ten out of ten would recommend \
I didn't realize it was possible to get this excited about pens  \
No I reall- I'm particular about my pens I like my point three eight gel pens  \
No I don't \
I- What do you mean I have a weird thing for mechanical\
You like
\f1  
\f0 mechanical pencils\
what kind of mechanical pencils\
Oo somebody sounds agressive and something's recording you  \
Yeah  \
Have you seen Lauren recently or you don't wanna talk about that \
but let's not talk about it \
Do you think I can go to the bathroom \
No\
I should probably wait \
how many credits do you have now \
that was really uncomfortable\
And then this little beat that was like \
And so this will be three and a half\
I'm at three now I think  \
So I'm ahead of you \
I have to I-I  I can't believe you're ahead of me in everything  \
I also finish the mastering chem last night \
I'll I'll just have to do well on the test I guess \
I've already feels like\
exam \
I'm like really ahead of \
But I do need to do my essay for my EM1 class \
I've emailed the teacher three times about putting the assignment file like that guidelines \
and he did post it  \
And it's not there I've emailed him three times \
That's very aggressive \
The first time he's like oh it's there like check \
and the second time I was like no it's not sorry\
he's like have you tried looking under this \
I don't think that's it why would he have malicious 
\f1 \uc0\u8968 
\f0 intentions
\f1 \uc0\u8969 
\f0 \
videos of us skiing \
and like post it for training and stuff \
but I was like watching them\
in the background and stuff  \
And I was just \
videos of me falling \
found a f-unny video of one of my friends falling \
I've seen your videos of you falling \
Did
\f1  
\f0 I show you the video of my friend Sadie falling  \
No is Sadie \

\f1  
\f0 best friends \

\f0 the super G \
It goes slalom g- giant slalom super giant slalom which is super G. \

And then giant slalom\
Oh you're supposed
\f1  
\f0 to hit them  \
No I mean you don't have to you're allowed to  \
And then giant slalom's like normal turns \
that's all po- really that seems really dangerous  \
Yeah well my first race I was so scared \
my fr- and \
he was like a all American skiier \
you want to try to impress him  \
yeah this is kind of a tame course I think \
I was like trying to pretend to like
\f1 \uc0\u8969 
\f0 \
Yeah
\f1  
\f0 so I was like oh cool                                                                                                         \
And inside
\f1  
\f0 I was like like out oh my god \
but anyways \
my fr- Sadie like \
Wait was it like a thing where she texs- collecs- \
where she collects snow as she goes and it's like a snowball \
the car ad \
the car's like zipping up the mountain and the snow starts going and it's like misses it every time\
like little snowballing \
That doesn't actually happen in real life  \
No it did in the ad and the ad looked real  \
Yeah in the ad \
It does it could happen\
You're fr- how you're from is there not snow in DC  \
It gets so warm and then it gets slushy and gross \
I'm s-serious like during we're gonna go skiing \
Oh I don't know about that  \
We're gonna go skiing\
Maybe
\f1  
\f0 I'll go skating that seems more fun\
than you'll come skiing with me \
I don't even know where I go skiing \

I just wanna go skiing right now \
I've been very antsy  \
About skiing \
 I wanna snapchat this\
it's so weird\
it looks like a mirror\
I know\
it's so minty\
you should've pulled it out\
tie the string around your handle\
tie it around\
do you know what I mean\
pull it up\
so inexperienced\
I don't drink tea\
I only drink water\
do that and then\
and do what\
then get the mike\
after this\
and then what\
and then\
you did\
I only have comp fifteen homework now\

I'll just actually learn comp 16\
you gotta sleep too \
you only slept like two hours today\
yeah and I slept like four hours\
the day before that\
I don't know how I'm still functioning\
and we didn't even study\
because of you\
I was trying to study\
no you weren't\
Do you wanna\
You did\
How long has it been\
Do you know\
We got here at fifteen\
It's probably been like fifteen minutes ish\
Yeah so it's not gonna take like an hour\
What should we do\
That would be like\
Yeah cuz you have to walk to class\
Feels like my throat is getting better\
you've been you've had a cough for so long\
Duh\
Eyebrow thing this way \
I try to balance it out by doing this\
Your muscle isn't you're just pushing it up your muscle isn't actually doing anything\
I do right hand\
My dad said\
It's always like right handed\
That's so sad\
My dad just like made me do right hand\
I mean that makes sense\
That's what my grandpa says\
He told me to not change it\
Can't do anything about that\
I'm really good at golf\
I golfed until like sixth grade\
am I gonna actually make it through just the first semester\
take it\
oh wow\
so you had to re study everything\
I didn't know the material well enough then so it gave me more time\
which is my interest so\
wow\
where are you from\
cool I'm from Seattle\
so I was up there all summer\
where in the Puget Sound\
had a middle school trip up there\
oh really\
were you like in the cabins and stuff\
that's cool\
I wouldn't doubt it\
you think you'll move back\
would like to check out California\
wherever has I guess the job or something to do\
so you're looking for jobs now\
then I'll then I'll worry about it\
All those three places are really great\
Wow\
I play club soccer\
We're performing tomorrow\
Hip hop\
Well breaking is the right term\
break dance is not the right term\
A lot of it is improv\
What does gentrified mean\
It does here\
Do you guys get much rain in LA\
No not at all \
Rain so much more often\
Maybe not now because of the droughts\
It isn't\
That has some effect I think \
But it is one of the top ten gloomiest\
Sometimes when I'm there I'm like the sun will come out\
Yeah I know\
Two thousand sixteen\
Just didn't really happen\
It was just like rained a lot\
Are you still a swimmer \
Somerville and Boston are a bit more wild\
How so\
I think a lot about food\
I do love food being a swimmer eat a lot\
I don't swim that often\
Yeah so now you're trying that again\
When I was younger and it's just so freeing\
You can play uh intramural\
Go and get some buddies or something and go play\
What else are you in this semester\
let's talk about the questions\
yeah sure\
I did all of them except five\
I forgot what the parietal lobe did\
I forgot what it did too\
I said it was in there so I'm like maybe that gets me something\
observational versus experimental study\
don't know what's going on\
there are apparently two different classes\
how are you expected to know anything\
Arabic is so different\
oh my god\
Russian apparently is really hard too\
then I could work at like a high school \
I really wanna take one of his classes\
I had two AP credits\
Wait you \
I didn't like place out because there's like four requirements in total\
I don't need one because like I'm taking like psych and child study \
So like I just think it'd be fun to take a history class\
what year are you\
um I'm a sophomore\
looking at the computer and just like read to us\
so that's like I don't know\
yeah it's like I can read\
wow\
um I haven't decided\
that's cool\
where you from\
um you mean on campus\
in a suite\
that's like super downhill\
I feel like the only good thing about\
I like to like read\
house of cards and friends\
I love friends\
I haven't really watched it\
yeah it's great\
to kill a mockingbird\
and it's stuff like that\
he tries to like figure out how to \
he creates this thing of\
small pox doesn't have a cure\
because he just does like bad things for the country\
I would definitely go check that book out\
I have like watch it for like so many times\
like from season one to season ten\
I can just like review it one again and again\
that's my favorite series\
yeah it was great\
oh that's fun\
we perform some of the Chinese dance\
we will perform in the parade of nations\
that's fun\
have you like applied to any of the clubs\
will you go home for winter\
are your midterms over\
that's how mine are too\
I have two midterms and then a final and that's it\
yeah that's gonna be kinda hard\
we like went through a whole textbook\
and then like\
starting from eight thirty\
I am always like excited to go that class\
and then I switched to arabic\
she's just like an impressive human being\
can you draw and stuff\
yeah me neither\
I didn't even know this building like existed\
I know this building because I have to go to my bio office hours\
I nap for like an hour\
studying\
and then I just go back to my room\
it's kinda homey\
so that's fun\
do you go to Davis a lot\
yeah I go to CVS a lot\
lots of stuff there\
colors that makes me feel like calm\
it's my favorite\
what's your favorite animal\
I don't have as many friends as some of my other peers and then I feel ilke a little lonely\
but like\
it's hard for me to either like to maintain a like a relationship or a friendship\
sometimes I don't really get the social like codes here so\
what are like the social codes what do you mean\
I don't know\
yeah but like sometimes\
sometimes I could spend a whole day without like really hang out with the friends\
yeah me too\
I'm not big into like asking people to do stuff with me either\
yeah I know what you mean\
it's the same stuff every time\
I don't know if I really like this kind of meaningless socialization\
yeah I think it's pointless too I don't do it\
I like your watch\
what man would wear that watch\
are you a big online shopper\
I always shop online\
keep buying\
I have so many shoes\
what's your favorite movie\
it's a movie called um midnight in paris\
do you know that film\
another movie which is a like uh\
what about you\
have you heard of\
he's basically like a secret agent\
and then like learns who he was and doesn't like it\
the movies are great and so are the books\
so first of all what's your name\
I'm a freshman what about you\
what dorm are you\
there's like six rooms and like one common room\
I think it's sophomore only this year\
do you like it\
actually pretty nice\
oh really\
Dewick \
Carm\
I've always eaten at Carm\
I still like ate mostly at Carm \
my mom um I think dormed Haskell her freshman year\
Oh your mom went to Tufts\
actually my dad did too \
and they met here\
which is kind of cool \
someone from my high school's doing that this semester\
bio psych\
oh right\
right no that makes sense\
yeah that makes sense because that's gonna be tough\
I want to speak the language well\
so you should\
how about you\
London would be a cool like a good semester trip and then like\
they're like \
Yeah I'm an art and science student and I I'm doing the\
it's definitely interesting\
at least you don't have to do comp forty\
Or even winter\
Which like I play on \
there're like other club teams\
Yeah he's\
He said he moved to London\
Who else on the rugby\
What school'd you go to\
Is also the kid who plays rugby and club tennis\
That's how I know him\
What is that called\
What's that library called\
Do you guys\
Is that where have your psych one class\
It's where I had mine\
I have two classes\
I got my space I've got space wanders\
That's cool\
Is that how you're filling your natural sciences\
Funny that he says\
Some of my friends did a rap song last year\
Supernovas\
It was really funny\
Was it good\
I think we're gonna do like an interstellar\
Different planets and stuff\
I'm gonna have to take that\
It's so hard to coordinate people\
I have this thing\
And it's like Wednesday night\
Okay so I'm gonna have to take experimental\
Maybe not experimental I'm in stats\
I guess they'll just make me keep doing psych studies\
I was thinking about picking up like a human development and child study minor\
what what room is it\
it's definitely it's a tough concept\
Kind of trippy\
We have that for like my English class\
So it's just one desk and we're all just sitting around it\
Eight of us or ten of us\
Then you just win\
Is that a different format than like the high school format\
I was definitely not used to the environment\
We had practice\
We'd be like pretty devastated\
And then you add up your games\
All the games you win\
Those are just insane\
How many people in your like in your suite\
Yeah so there's ten people in my suite\
It's crazy\
Which is down hill and kinda actually pretty nice\
So I'm doing um I probably wanna do (eh) at least a semester.\
And I'm trying to kinda like plan it out\
In a way where like I can still do the abroad program \
come back and like still not be completely behind\
It's just like it seems like they have something to do every single day for that class\
That's like kind of dope \
You're in a suite that's kinda dope \
The only other suite I've seen is Sophia Gordon\
We all share a common room and a bathroom\
Connected to like another suite I guess\
Feel like in one of those hillside appartments\
I probably wouldn't want to do that\
If you want to yeah\
But I could probably do wait so you're the hillside that's umm those are apartment buildings\
umm there's like no RAs in the building\
I think they their they're really cool\
So you can just like kinda like relax like not have to worry about like\
Through like a door\
Also you have your own kitchen which is pretty dope so if you're not on a meal plan \
I forgot about that you like can't have a microwave\
I brought we brought a fridge umm like very early on\
And like they're like like yeah no you can't do that\
You don't want the RA to come and be like illegal microwave\
I think a few people in our room in our dorm just have like our whole have just bought microwaves\
Wait what floor of Tilton are you on \
I'm on T three\
You're T Three? \
Okay yeah cool what room\
Uhh three nineteen \
Umm I assume there is\
I think one of my friends lived in like three twenty or something last year\
I met this kid Ben who is like who lived in our room last year\
Ohhh really did you meet the people who lived in your room last year\
Yeah we did it's pretty funny\
That's cool he's a sophomore \
Sophomore yeah\
I feel like I don't know that many sophomores, I do club tennis\
So I learned a lot about umm I learned some I learned some sophomores \
Do you know ummm Michael Rsierra \
I think he's on club tennis \
Maybe maybe maybe mile \
Yeah Mike okay\
Umm it was it was like not that many kids showed up for practices and stuff you know I met Say do you know who Say is \
Yeah I think so I think I know him through Michael\
Yeah umm and then Derek is a senior \
Ummm but it was fun I mean I'm kind of like its kind of disappointing because all the sports kinda just died just died down\
That's so funny \
We have like practices at like seven\
Right I'm I might want to fo and try out for the Rugby\
I came and joined rugby I like had no clue what I was doing for like a year\
Everyone caught me up to speed like \
Everyone is super welcoming\
I've definitely I definitely know the game umm and I because I I lived in Paris\
Uhh so like all there was to watch was Rugby\
Yeah OK cool if you know the game like you're already ahead of everyone\
Oh those are a lot of fun\
So I definitely would be interested in doing it\
So did you you consider studying studying abroad in France because you said you were going to do it\
Yeah its definitely probably pretty interesting \
A lot of juniors are still twenty years old\
A lot of people do abroad junior year\
You could just have fun actually for your junior year and not have to worry about like\
Wait so where did you live there you said you lived there for three years\
Umm and this the city umm how long uhh did you always grow up in New York\
Yeah umm I think this city at the this summer I did an internship \
Oh yeah that's awesome\
It is umm definitely cool being in the city it's definitely umm \
Did you stay there or did yo commute metro north\
It was kind of brutal because it'd be like seven in the morning\
Yeah we still like play against like RCDS Rye country day school\
Oh yeah \
Oh yeah Rye country day \
Very uhhh Chappy kids\
Yeah exactly umm you know they don't care \
Double alumni like board of trustees guys\
Its fair rye country days is known for definitely known for that \
Yeah I I feel like the public schools nearby are a lot better \
Yeah exactly the rye the rye rye area is very nice umm \
And then even like newer shell like Scarsdale nice \
Yeah we uhh we like synched up before the year \
Oh cool so you knew your roommate before going in \
Now I just met someone yesterday  who was talking about how like they've had such a hard time with their roommate \
Oh single \
I was kind of excited for going to college because like aww I don't have to worry about like having a roommate \
Like I kind of already want to room with uhh someone who went to my high school who is also from tufts \
So even hard \
Yeah for sure yeah I can really stud in my suite that's like the thing is just like I went in with like with like nine other friends \
So its like the ten of us \
Like someone's always has the we have a TV set up we have like a speaker set up someone is like playing music \
Someone is always doing something \
Yes so especially downstairs in like the cadet like that like you know like is that where you had your psych one class it's where I had mine\
We like we we got our group together yesterday in the library to like figure it out because like we're like oh god we do not know what we're doing\
Physical to turn in\
The group projects are always the hardest because you have to like coordinate everyone.\
Ive felt like that's the difference between Tufts and like my high school\
You have all that time like even if you didn't have like a period or class \
Oh that one's just ss my favorite unit\
Like ummm developmental like psychology \
It's definitely I think it's definitely more interesting \
The first thing is really technical \
Different parts of the brain and like shit like that\
How did did your grades go up throughout the year \
Immm I think I started high went low and then ended high again\
I took umm like one semester of psychology and one semester of neuroscience \
Interesting choices sixteen multiple choice but if you get one wrong it's like your grade drops\
If you get one wrong you're already down to a ninety six \
Yeah exactly it's kinda annoying \
Yeah I think uhh I forget their requirements exactly but it's a year of bio a year of chem \
Umm yeah orgo one org two or instead of orgo two it could be bio chem \
Other other than that it's just like two English classes \
Okay\
Uhh some sort of statistics class \
I think I placed out of English I did yeah I placed out of the writing requirement at Tufts \
Oh you placed out of the yeah did you take the AP\
I took the AP AP Lang \
I loved it so like I loved AP Lang\
I placed out of the writing requirement but I'm actually still doing ummm intro to philosophy \
Oh yeah that's English too\
I I have Ian Blownstein\
Ian Blownstein I've never \
He's like an Emerson teacher\
What are you reading like uhh what philosophy books are you reading\
Oh cool \
Umm we did the first two questions\
We wrote essays on were like \
Umm and then uhhh another one was umm \
umm and and just said that we're not responsible ever \
Tarberla Rafah \
Yeah it is on my test tomorrow for sure \
Hahaha umm \
If I was personally morally reprehensible \
That's what I thought about as I was writing it\
Yeah the injustice kinda just seems kind of like some something society needs\
Some like reparation I guess\
And just bounce \
I'm from the pre med like English requirement \
Workshop them and like \
Everyone has their own turn to tell like their story be the focus and everyone talks\
And you have to lead your own workshop and like when it's your own story like ask questions\
This sh-- I mean I remember in high school I did my junior year when I did AP Lang \
Umm and like that helped everything else in that class \
Umm I feel like in my mind the best like the best\
Umm I was getting different like perspectives a lot of issues umm I felt like that was like \
Umm everyone hears each other \
That's true especially when people \
For sure\
For sure\
Yeah true\
Umm it's it's like a tough thing to solve\
Involved in any clubs here umm which I would like to do are there is there did I miss a club fair I probably did \
Yeah there is a club fair like in the first few weeks but there's one every semester so like if you miss out this semester don't worry\
It was like it was kinda of umm\
Like I barely knew the campus at that point and it was kind of disorganized \
Yeah tons of people it like seems like strangers \
Exactly and you're just like why don't I Tae Kwan Do club \
The only club I joined my fre- freshman year \
Yeah honestly like Will talk- Will like Will's a good friend of mine \
At least keeps you on some sort of schedule \
Like it keeps you on a team I don't know if you are you if you are like on a sport's team in high school \
Because like the team is counting on me to show up \
But also it's fun because those people become your friends \
Umm this like the D three club division called the nesgrow New England small college \
That's sick \
Umm a \
Because we can couldn't speel the field space at tufts \
Cold like practicing outside \
Especially like my class of freshmen \
Those are so there's like four of us and those four people were all living in a suite \
Yeah we have an off campus house to live in \
I see are there are there cuts to uhh to rugby \
Umm there are no cuts \
There's like an A side \
Like discontinued yeah \
Bumped down to club \
We we are sort of fighting for it back \
Yeah so from D three if you play with UCONN and BC \
That's a J-- yeah for tennis we just had sectionals \
Uhh \
oh shit \
And we played umm like we were playing like the D one teams \
hub umm BC yeah we played BC \
Dartmouth had an Ex Varsity player \
Umm and then we played MIT \
umm and which is D three and then umm \
Clearly D one\
Wait so how does how does it\
But I guess it's in a team setting \
Uhh and out of five so you play five matches and you play and you play sets of like six \
Like people really wanted to move on \
Two or three weeks honestly before sectionals \
Really so sectionals \
Yeah umm sectionals was like the end of it \
We almost made it to nationals we lost \
Uhuh crap\
In the last possible match \
And that's who who was \
Uhh yeah \
We would have gone to Orlando \
Oh sick \
Umm more I think about it the more I'm like \
Yeah that really it's a lot \
Missed spring fling \
Waka Flocka was here right or no \
I think it was like Amena or whatever  like Metro Boom \
Or Young Metro \
Honestly I hope we get a good like I want a line up for this year \
Yeah I forget who was fall fest first year \
I went and left \
It was just like it was just like a weird crowd I feel like to uhhh to them like it was like it didn't make any sense because it foes him with like a small crowd \
Like yeah I'll check it out it's Gold Link \
He's like a good artist \
Yeah totally \
Literally the day after that the Tufts and two days like after he was just like here anyways and they got him to go to Tufts but I feel like he wasn't that into like playing here \
But it's like at Tufts it was just like in a school gym\
what was your name again\
nice to meet you\
it's very different than high school\
where are you from\
how so\
why am I quiet\
gotcha\
they kind of find their group\
no one has their crowd yet\
and like no one's set\
it's weird it's like just going by so quickly\
yeah it's kinda far\
what were you doing\
my brother's doing an internship out there\
he's not that smart\
I mean a lab is pretty impressive we have a lot of those\
a lot of labs\
a lot of labs in Seattle\
yeah or like\
I think everyone who leaves after high school\
I'm glad we decided that\
No I agree though\
sounds cool\
you should come up\
have you skied before\
oh word\
have you ever been\
it's incredible\
there are like two huge mountains\
it's like the longest gondola in the world\
is there like a huge drop yeah\
you're like going over it and you're like oh my god\
I haven't really skied out here very much \
I don't know last year no one really had cars\
just cuz like some of my friends have cars\
sking here is just not\
we do have little bunny hills\
it was in\
and it was just\
so this is what skiing is like\
you guys have it so good\
cuz I'm just like\
you're not missing much\
you like don't come back\
like you have to plan the whole day\
yeah and you have to be like\
you just have no hopes\
just cuz all the mountains are so big\
it's really nice\
pretty much the states that don't have skiing\
where is like the best places to ski\
I was like oh like have you heard of\
and she was like um yes\
how far away do you live\
do you get do you guys drive or fly\
cool\
it's good\
cuz there are lots of places to stay and like the village is really fun\
oh sure sure sure\
no way\
that's where I wanna be you know\
it's so nice\
gotcha\
is that why you're\
because you have six hours right\
I'm in psych stats now so I have to do four\
oh you're not in intro to psych alright\
I'm not sure if that's true though\
I can't think of any other classes that do\
luckily you don't have to do it that well\
it's definitely good to be on top of it\
how do you like intro to psych\
it's good\
who do you have\
she's the department head\
yeah he's great\
And I should just like get it over with and take it next semester\
\
and it's just like so annoying\
\
and it\'92s like a internal struggle I\'92ve been having these past few days since classes come out\
This is just your second psych class that you\'92re in now or your third\
I was thinking about majoring in it but I\'92m not not too sure yet\
Are you pre med\
Like the psych intro classes are just like not fantastic\
Like intro to psych did not blow me off my feet\
I also don\'92t think that\'92s a good like indicator of the psych classes \
The upper level psych courses are really cool \
What do you mean by that\
Like after the first exam he like sent me an email \
And I was like thank you\
Just if you show up\
He just like wants you to do well\
You\'92ll get an extra two percent\
You know\
It\'92s just a really nice environment\
I\'92m thinking about asking him to be my advisor\
Like I know some people in comp sci-fi who just like\
They were just like assigned someone\
Might ask him\
She is kind of in love with him\
I think I might be too\
Their friend who goes texts them like who to log on to learning catalytic \
I feel like that\'92s fine\
This class is so expensive if you like divide it up\
Come on go to class\
You don\'92t even have that much class\
What else are you doing that\'92s so important\
If you\'92re already on your computer like\
And then you\'92re just sitting there like refreshing\
I don\'92t know it\'92s just dumb and people should just go to class\
Agreed agreed\
Did you take bio last year as well\
No I took chem all of last year\
Oh me too\
Oh really\
Bio is much easier than chem\
That\'92s tough\
I don\'92t know how much chem you did in high school\
Yeah also I just like think it\'92s \
You need chem for bio but you don\'92t need bio for chem\
It was hard coming in first semester and just like taking chem one right off the bat\
I have like a relatively like fine time with those\
And this class just like knocked the wind out of me\
I just like didn\'92t know how to take a science class you know at college\
Especially cuz they\'92re big lecture halls\
Fifty kids all clumped around her and I was like nope\
Unless it\'92s like a huge question\
Very true\
Do it for yourself in a way\
At the end you\'92re like\
I have some friends who I did it with last year \
We\'92re like yeah \
Like what do you do\
I am a part of peer health exchange\
Crazy\
What do you guys do\
Yeah wait have you never heard of just like burlesque in general\
Wild okay\
How do I put this\
My God\
Interesting I might go check it out\
Only at the campus center \
I\'92ve never had to buy a ticket before because I\'92ve always been in it\
I don\'92t know if tickets cost I think they\'92re free\
Interesting\
And then some of them are really good\
You have rehearsal once a week\
There are two shows\
There\'92s a five PM show and there\'92s a nine PM show\
No one really goes to the five PM show\
Oh shoot\
Soak up all the alcohol they\'92re drinking\
Goodness \
Some people really like it\
So I do that\
So like there\'92s a lot of training\
The first semester is more about training\
Starting in like late November and December I\'92ll teach a lot more\
Next semester I\'92ll teach a lot\
There\'92s a lot of like things you can do to just like put in on your resume\
Have you gotten involved in anything\
Just testing out the waters for now\
I joined the club soccer team\
Oh that\'92s cool\
Club teams are such a great way to like make communities\
We have time\
True\
So we had a game scheduled\
And it was okay\
It wasn\'92t a really big deal\
But like \
They kind of have to\
We got suspended for a week\
The admin asked the captains if they had played like went down to play brown and they said no\
They asked brown if we had played them\
Wait why\'92d they lie about whether or not they went to play brown\
We went to play brown\
Your captains are just dumb\
I feel you for sure\
But now we can\'92t play \
Are you guys like doing anything\
Oh how do you like that\
I\'92m gonna join the ski team\
I have some good friends on the ski team\
Have you raced before\
I think that\'92s a good community too\
They throw a lot of parties\
They drink a lot of beer\
Cool\
I think that\'92s good\
People are like oh it\'92s going to be so fun \
You\'92re just gonna like side right in\
A huge difference from like living with your parents and whatever\
So I could just like hang out with people\
I think that\'92s what I\'92m doing\
Throughout the year\
Cuz like classes can be overwhelming\
It\'92s better to like give yourself more leeway\
I can\'92t believe we have another bio test next week\
We have one on the ninth right\
It\'92s a week from tomorrow\
Cuz I was sick\
Sent us an email saying this is the date\
How\'92d it go\
It went well \
I had a lot of time to study\
That\'92s that\'92s a while so I\'92m sure she like just changed the entire test probably \
Do you know if she gave you the same one\
No she couldn\'92t have\
How about you\
What\'92s his name\
I also have some good friends there\
Very close to going to both those schools but came here\
I liked the city vibe\
It\'92s a lot to learn in three and a half weeks\
Which is like one class\
Would you take it somewhere in Seattle\
No I would take it here\
Oh you\'92d take it here\
I think it\'92s just better to take it here\
Cuz then it can like go on my Tufts transcript\
But like in the beginning\
Yeah so you\'92re just gonna hang out\
I guess it can\'92t transfer though\
You took it at this school \
And you got this grade\
And then you were like do like a post bar\
Gotcha\
Because then you like see\
They are writing briefs a lot\
Like you\'92re just dealing with crazy people all day\
And you\'92re just like fighting all day\
Like she was made to do her job\
I think he just like\
Were his parents lawyers as well\
They were just like\
He didn\'92t really know what he wanted to do so he was like\
I don\'92t really know if it was the best for him\
You\'92re just like fighting all day\
I can see that\
It\'92s like what I\'92m better at\
Do you know what kind of doctor you wanna be\
I don't know where that is\
nice to meet you\
um you go to Tufts or\
yeah\
I don't know\
what year are you\
psych one or\
Tilton so downhill\
going to Dewick\
do you know what you're gonna study or\
I'm also pre med\
I don't know what I'm gonna major in yet\
gotcha\
you know mainly football\
so so like the main ones\
yeah the main ones\
but yeah\
I don't know if you know it\
yeah I never watch it\
or you haven't\
I just watched Stranger Things\
the second season\
I've heard that's like\
people who watch it\
my stats professor\
cuz it's a bunch of references and shit\
it's okay but like\
what's it even about\
there like these weird demons from different\
it's weird\
cool\
I was like yeah at our high school\
there's these like\
that's intense\
giant science fairs\
oh it was awful\
Trying to think of the science fairs I've been too\
that was that was the main one\
no I just did most of the ones that were like near my school\
so uh why did you choose Tufts or like\
so why did you choose Tufts or like how'd you get here\
yeah which is bad\
I bet no one's in then\
that's pretty nice\
it's interesting that we have a sailing team\
I know and that they lift weights but\
you never know\
I feel it feels like lacrosse is a big deal like\
I don't know about the west coast\
it's much bigger\
how big's the team\
there's almost forty\
I was gonna say how many people can play on the field at a time\
only like eleven or twelve are on the field\
people probably get cut\
I don't know anyone who plays lacrosse\
you guys have a big track team right\
oh that's cool\
wait\
where are you living at\
how about you\
that's where I lived\
what floor do you live on\
two eleven so like right\
I loved it\
it's pretty good\
do you have a roommate or do you have a single\
no I'm in a double so\
yeah I'd say so\
he's a good roommate\
nice\
awesome\
no the later one\
so we're in different ones\
I'm in the morning one\
what are like your hobbies\
I'm a coxen on the men's crew team\
that's really cool\
one in the fall and one in the spring\
it like takes up most of my time\
other than that I kinda just like study\
it's kind of like forty five minutes away\
Connecticut's pretty small\
how about you\
that must be fun\
yeah it's it's a nice area\
bio thirteen\
I think she's on sabbatical\
I study chemistry and Spanish\
pre med \
same\
awesome\
I would definitely recommend it\
if you decide to like major in bio or chem or something\
I think it helps with med school\
how's your week been going\
going good\
it's actually my birthday today\
no way happy birthday\
since they're in the play offs I was like you know like\
where'd you go to high school was it like \
so like it was a\
like you had to test in to get in\
it was a very humanities oriented school it like drove the humanities out of me\
so like a lot of history\
they drove it out of me man\
public high school\
bio and psych\
comp eleven\
comp sci\
do you like that\
I know I want to major in bio but like I really like\
I want to take data structures next\
mixed things about comp eleven\
the first half from the second half\
yeah I bet\
calc one okay\
so that's decent\
what are you taking besides psych one\
oh really\
that's my fourth class\
that's cool\
Like a distribution requirement\
Okay\
Leaving home and just like starting college\
Yeah no same\
I thought I would miss like my parents and my dog\
right yeah\
What kind of dog do you have\
You have do you have any pets\
Yeah I have a beagle \
Yeah dogs are the best\
Do you know what you want to take next year for classes\
Bio fifteen\
Comp fifteen\
Because I know you need that\
You need calc one\
I don\'92t think for pre med\
I haven\'92t done any arts yet\
Arts and like another social science\
Is that why you\'92re doing psych\
I just needed one\
Psych is good cuz it kinda helps for the MCAT so\
Let me try it out\
What do you think of the class so far for psych\
I do like I think it\'92s okay\
I\'92ve never taken psych in my life\
It\'92s good yeah\
All the people in the class like are faces I\'92ve never seen\
I just like know one or two people\
But I like also how it\'92s three professors and you like change it\
What else have we not talked about\
I feel like we\'92re having an interview\
So far at Tufts\
Did you do pre-o\
I did go actually\
Did you like them\
As like a freshman \
I was a peer leader for two years\
I liked it\
Like all of the games that you do\
Ice breakers and stuff\
So you can kind of\
Do you get paid or is it volunteer\
That all say Tufts on them\
Interesting\
A few days early\
Talks with different like deans at Tufts and like the OEO \
Cuz OEO is like training right\
You kind of know\
What is like a fit what\'92s like a typical day of fit\
Like it\'92s super busy\
Yeah so\
Talks either from like Tufts athletics or Tufts deans\
Options that they\'92ll have like of things to get involved in\
Did you have to like drive\
I couldn\'92t drive at the time\
Wow\
I didn\'92t like barely eat anything\
There was no basketball involved\
Like whipped me into\
It was terrible\
You do that every day\
Since I just go and I kind of steer the boat and like yell at them\
I don\'92t actually have to do physical activity\
My role in the boat\
Controls for the rudder\
As they\'92re rowing they can\'92t see where they\'92re going\
So like I make sure that we don\'92t hit anything and like\
Different workouts or\
So like if we\'92re off the water\
Like if we\'92re in the gym or something\
An erg test\
It\'92s like do you know what\
That thing yeah\
When we have a test \
If you did track and were like running a mile\
What their stroke rating was\
And like what other\
Like go around and take down their times\
It\'92s cool if the coxens do the workouts when we\'92re off the water\
So like I usually do end up doing them\
I ran in high school so I\'92m like fit enough to do them\
My like view on it is that\
I wouldn\'92t get cut\
Didn\'92t think about it\
It wouldn\'92t like make sense to make us captain\
So the way it works is\
The weight is one twenty five\
So it\'92s just kind of a way to make it fair\
They try to like normalize it to a certain weight\
But then our coach puts the novice boat\
Why\
It\'92s kind of more prestigious \
So he\'92ll like\
Then\
And you\'92re like faster\
Then he\'92ll put you in the novice boat\
Faster than people in the novice boat can\'92t be in it \
Second year or third year rowing\
So like when I was a freshman I was in the novice boat\
I couldn\'92t be in the novice boat anymore\
I like ended up moving up \
So you\'92re like the top coven\
Damn that\'92s so cool awesome\
That\'92s that\'92s dope\
Yeah no it\'92s pretty cool\
What do you mean by seat races\
We\'92ll race\
The other person will move into this boat\
Oh so it\'92s like you\'92re manipulating like to see\
And then you\'92ll race again\
Then clearly making that switch\
It made the boat go slower\
If you get switched you\'92re like okay I gotta really train\
Everything was set and my coach knew who was faster and who was slower\
yes it's it's pretty similar\
ten thirty through eleven forty five\
and then on Tuesday and Thursday \
I have like an afternoon class and an evening class\
Monday and Wednesday\
that's cool \
how's your schedule\
it's really nice right now\
I have like four on one day\
it's really balanced yeah\
have a nine thirty instead of a ten thirty so that's awful\
what are you kind of like building up on\
I'm taking Latin three just to get get the first language\
intro to cognitive and brain science\
that's so funny\
See this is the problem \
even though I've been in my classes for like an entire semester sometimes I still blank on them when people ask\
oh and discrete mathematics\
what does that imply\
I went to google it\
you have done calculus\
so I did calculus only deals with continuous functions\
discrete mathematics is everything else\
I know there's gonna be some graphs some stuff with like\
lines that break and crap like that\
what's up with it\
very like math based also\
I have stat\
now I'm like trying sociology just to get a break from that\
nice\
calc two \
yeah calc two was kind of\
I have to take calc two at some point and I'm kind of putting it off\
yeah okay so I only got to AB so\
it's sort of like everyone takes\
and most people did pre cal\
my my school has a lot of my high school had a lot of weird structure\
you go to a private school or a public school\
that's interesting\
what like other big like monster obviously\
a couple headsets right\
you have the like all the big computer companies\
steel series\
all those they're all of them are sponsors\
okay right\
they have like a bunch of sports blogs\
the energy drink\
all the energy drinks are big ones\
and then for small teams\
you don't get as they don't get much atten from a lot of traditional companies\
is like the biggest sponsor of the league\
I think it's actually more common in the south\
I've never heard of one on the east coast\
things people think gamers want\
okay that's really funny\
yeah never really knew that much about industry\
what made you decide to come to Tufts\
that didn't really sway me that much\
the best school I could've gone into\
that's awesome\
what about you\
my sister goes to Harvard and so I applied there\
very top level school\
yeah no it's all good me too\
twenty minutes from here\
is that south of boston\
it's like near south boston\
oh okay\
oh sweet\
um what school did you go to\
just in a suburb\
do you know\
that's awesome\
is he a junior\
I should probably know that\
what year are you\
you're a senior\
how you feeling\
I mean I 'm good\
my concern is just like finishing everything\
there are kids\
I'll be doing a lotta applying like next semester\
oh okay\
we just had a project due last thursday\
did you really\
like on the reg\
that's the type of kid he is\
he presents himself\
child development is just like\
I've thought about teaching \
I don't know if I have that type of patience\
They\'92re a little messy\
Out of school setting\
And then I hurt my back\
So I was like \
You have to do a sport each season\
That\'92s my guy\
New incoming freshman\
He missed like a good half\
Which is bad\
You guys tried out for fall ball\
Interact with us \
We have the normal lifts\
We play a nine inning inter team scrimmage\
If you just wanted to show up\
That\'92s kind of dope\
He\'92s a very like funny strange kid\
You love him\
It\'92s cuz he like doesn\'92t go to schoo\
Doesn\'92t go to school here\
In blue house and all that okay\
He\'92s never on campus\
See him every now and then\
It\'92s and it\'92s always like some ridiculous first\
First interaction\
He\'92s wild\
Just essays \
I have mostly essays\
I have this this test is Frida\
Are you oh you\'92re not in this class\
Well \
Oh okay \
The stat class\
Psych stats\
Oh there you go\
So I was like am I gonna make i\
I got blessed yeah\
How many credits did you have to do\
Yeah\
Kind of left it to the last minute\
It always does\
I had four exams last week\
That was brutal\
Get outta here early\
And then three like ten more or less page papers\
Not looking fu\
Thirty pages worth of writing\
I haven\'92t like even looked at the prompt\
Do it yeah \
I\'92m gonna pull an all nighter\
Yeah hopefully\
You live with Mike\
Uh huh\
You live with Mike\
That\'92s my guy right there\
Oh man\
He\'92s like one of my favorite\
We live on the same floor together\
One of our friends who actually transferred \
And he sort of got just got us connected\
And he plugged you in\
That\'92s a good look\
Kinda mentally not totally in it\
He just looked disheveled as hell\
Kid\'92s a clown\
He is nuts though\
In latin way\
As a senior which is awfu\
This was in \
would have been a good look\
Or nine other random kids\
I knew like two of the\
And a lot of them are sophomores\
I mean it\'92s straigh\
There you go\
I got a suite next semester so I\'92m good\
Kind of but we\'92re just gonna make it\
Yeah my friend\
Since it\'92s a reciprocal I have a good one next year\
The guys that I\'92m living with\
My other friends wanna use my number\
That\'92s not gonna fly is it\
Yeah I mean yeah don\'92t make it obvious\
No I mean you already got your house\
Pay for the on campus housing\
That would be a bad look\
Your parents would definitely be pissed\
I was about to say I was about to say something\
Go talk to them in person they\'92re like pretty chill\
You were in the basement too\
And his mom I don\'92t know if you\'92ve met his mom\
She\'92s she\'92s just she\'92s one of a kind\
Wouldn\'92t put it past it yeah\
We were looking for housing for sophomore year\
She just like ripped them a new one\
And she\'92s just like starts going in\
Sophomore year yeah\
I\'92m gonna set you asid\
And then like halfway through the year\
You\'92ll get what you want\
That\'92s funny\
It was by far the biggest\
Medford or Somerville or whatever it is\
That\'92s dope that\'92s dope\
What was I gonna say\
I noticed it when I first walked in\
This is funny\
I got it at assembly row\
It was at the outlet\
Is it really\
I was like alright lemme just grab the biggest size I could find\
No other guys rocking the same one\
How much time has passed\
You think we\'92re gonna get into like some awkward silence\
Oh damn so you\'92re\
You\'92re doing some serious shit here\
It\'92s just it\'92s a lot of math\
What do you want to do\
That\'92s I did that a lot\
Like in a \
I have four uncles and then an aunt\
You\'92ll definitely you\'92re definitely better than a lot of people\
And you\'92re coming from Tufts\
That\'92s the way I think\
That was on campus\
Yeah this was I mean this was just yesterday\
Senior year class line up \
I definitely got like yoga and like swimming\
And then like everything else\
Oh okay\
I didn\'92t know you needed thirty four classes to graduate\
Just bullshitting\
But I was just like na\
Bang it out\
It\'92s like really fun\
It\'92s a good time right\
Yeah it seems it seems fun though\
Yeah definitely a good time\
I\'92m definitely gonna look at it yeah\
Alright like when the time comes I\'92ll look at it\
Kind of whittle it down a little bit\
Yeah that\'92s true\
How was Madrid\
You\'92re not going abroad next semester\
Probably just one of the best decisions\
With anybody you knew\
Did you like coordinate\
Restaurants are literally on every single block\
So there just there\'92s restaurants\
Which is not a good thing\
I don\'92t wanna say a joke\
Spain or something like that\
one of my classes was like sketchbooking through madrid \
and just like\
you draw\
love that\
classes didn't start till like February\
it was bad yeah\
the classes aren't too hard\
you start pregaming probably like what is it twelve one\
you gotta make it to six or you're walking your ass home\
it was just wild \
it was a Tufts program\
oh okay\
gotcha\
but it was dope\
nice\
oh really\
if you wanted to like go see the Eiffel Tower or something\
I mean maybe even like\
I don't like jump right into a job\
yeah no bro I'm telling you\
yeah it changed the way I just view things\
I mean six months is a long time\
yeah I was about to say\
but his his the way his work work visa it was set up\
I think his position has not changed\
not even out the playing field but like help these other countries\
the USA just always dominates\
teaching basketball and like training and better training\
their influence a bit\
I feel ilke we're on a podcast or something\
I don't know\

I don't think you can play with me\
I was like\
Same\
oh my\
what do you mean\

I have no like time frame\
It literally could have been at any time\
just woke up with an ice pack\
but yeah\
I slept okay\
it's just on Saturday I stayed up to like\
we only went to Yule Ball from eight to eight thirty\
yeah I didn't like that one\
It's so good but you have to watch all the other episodes first\
all the other episodes of black mirror or just that season \
I have to do that tonight\
I just won't leave my room\
who's your favorite on the bachelorette\
I'm like they all already got out\

I also don't like his name\
how is how are your mice this morning\
the ones like did you think they were gonna make it\

I just have to present one research like neuroscience study\
and I'm like sitting there like \
is it\
didn't do the psych reading yet\
can you sh I don't know it yet\
the psych reading was like actally relevant to what hey're talking about\
I like didn't finsh it\
yeah when I got to the genetics stuff I ws like I already know this\
stay away with that chem knowledge\
sodium potassium pumps\
and I was like trigger word\
in bio thirteen\
I don't think we did sodium potassium pumps\
I don't remember those\
I think that's where I remember them\
bio fourteen's like plants\
what was it about\
I don't know it was like\
not like mitochondria\
that's this year\
so all about that plant\
did you learn about aerobic cellular respiration\
No I was helping my little brother study\
over break\
I don't remember\
I'm ready to test out\
is that a canada goose coat\
that's class of twenty seventeen\
oh my god\
that was us\
but not in here\
did you finish the psych readings\
this is what it does\
this is this part of the brain\
writing down super fast\
she seems like she's\
he texted me about it too so like\
that's all the time for him\
he's like tinder didn't go well but yeah\
the one that looks like she's from LA\
she's definitely\
she's like very like\
but they're friends from LA\
I wanted to like start a roast about it\
and then I wrote like isn't he pompous and then I deleted it\
cuz I think he's still friends with them\
he met this like skier he was like a senior\
he's gonna like try to slide into that\
he has this skateboard but he has the remote for it\
he just gets on it and he's like zoom\
it would go like this and I would just go like that\
what are they like the roller boards\
it's like you put your feet on it\
yeah yeah\
that's the word\
have you ever been on one of those\
oh my god it was\
it looked so scary\
I can't do that\
it's so horrible\
I like did it and like ran into like so many walls\
oh no\
my tailbone is like sore this morning\
so I was like I got a lift\
so it was like two thirty five for like the whole time\
I think I'm just gonna pour coffee\
do you think my little legs can handle that\
it was like twenty five minute walk\
do you wanna do it on the way back\
did you bring your chem stuff with you\
thinking ahead\
like thirty minutes before I was supposed to leave\
so it was like moderately dry like drying\
I was like that's fine I did it\
it's fine\
he had one last semester\
and then he got the light blue one\
what a weird move\
is it every other day\
last semester he just did everyday the jeans\
I mean the light blue look fine\
sorry to cough in your ear\
it's so loud\
I really like how these are two separate tables\
I was like is this a mirror\
yeah it looks like a mirror\
oh man\
oh my god\
what did you have to do for the audition\
there's like no it's not an audition it's an application\
Who dances\
like like dinner setting\
no this limb is falling down\
how do you save it\
what did you say for that\
I was just so overwhelmed\
that's a lot of pressure\
I don't need spanish\
like Zoe's\
which leader did I meet last night\
and then the like sort of red headed one \
the one that looks like the guy from ratatouille \
the one that looks like linguini\
the linguini was in it with us\
sky told me that because he was like can you guys do one dance \
I applied to three and got wait listed\
and I was like poor Sky\
you have to just get in because you have a response\
his was really his answers were really funny\
I don't know why he didn't get in\
and he applied to it and he he like there was a question\
they like rejected him no they actually waitlisted him \
I don't think he got in\
let me fill it out and say no\
I'm only gonna go to the later show\
I have a philosophy paper due\
and I like scrolled and I looked and I was like \
it's gonna be a rough weekend\
I like have to get through it\
when is it\
that's so far away\
what is the pass fail thing like we can't do it for requirements\
distribution requirements\
I couldn't do history pass fail\
what's the point in taking something pass fail\
because that wouldn't be your major\
easy or hard\
the add period's almost over\
I know but I don't need any more classes\
what are you saying\
why would you do that to yourself\
oh my god\
it would probably be this one\
no god I'm not starting chem now\
and it was like fifty four slides\
when do you have fifty four slides worth of content\
three of the slides are literally just collages of animal pictures\
and I was like\
it's like so useless to know this\
wait so it's like plants and animals\
insects\
environmental science in high school right\
it's like stuff you do in AP environmental science in high school\
I head that AP bio in high school I didn't take it but it was like a mixture of apes and like bio\
we did that a little bit in AP bio\
oh yeah\
we literally did a unit on like\
this is not what I wanna do\
oh my god\
do you also have a little plant in yours\
yeah most definitely is\
that one's not\
wise\
I see you\
when I was walking to this building\
and there was like a random gym\
I was like what is this gym\
it's an office building\
just like\
we'll investigate on the way out\
while we're waiting\
my Lyft driver was so nice\
that's so much walking\
I wanna bring my car senior year\
unless you live on the other side of campus\
equally bad food\
the one thing that does suck about being uphill\
unless they wanna like hike\
no thank you \
no to walking\
I read zero\
seventy pages over two nights isn't bad\
don't wanna do it\
I don't wanna do it\
I'm the wisest person\
I'm gonna like logic you out of being wise\
socrates please stop\
I don't know \
I feel like philosophy can be like a little bit pretentious\
I'm a nerd so like \
I'm a nerd who would never go to the gym\
you had to take a sport\
I took it online\
it was actually way more work \
my middle school like at my old school\
and it's just like what\
I did it over the summer\
so I didn't have to take gym\
I did like both of my gyms\
I could take like AP chem\
it was a lot of work\
I said like hey reach out\
and it's just like what\
wait did you\
I tried and the practice was just too much\
my hands were too small\
I think my hands were to small to be a \
then it says\
I've got the group mes on mute\
you can just put them on mute\
that's what I'm doing with my home town group chat\
that was probably a mistake\
I don't know as if he maybe they'd stop if you give it back\
which like doesn't sound late\
I set my nine thirty alarm clock\
even if I'm a little bit early like it doesn't matter\
does your roommate stay up late\
she stays up later than I do\
I sleep with headphones in\
YouTube videos\
you can listen to YouTube videos with your phone locked\
oh I didn't know that\
you can only if you have YouTube red\
I don't have that\
oh okay \
It's some android thing\
having YouTube red is separate\
it'd be awesome if\
did he work at your camp\
he has friends who have\
like what do they teach kids\
yeah he's really good at chess \
the oldest are like ten\
I'm just not sure his I don't know \
I know he worked at a camp before I think\
wait you have a plant too\
this is so funny\
if you look here\
like I feel like \
the curtains like closed like it's like moved to the left a little bit\
oh yeah it does\
and then the plant is there\
there's another plant over there\
I have a plant right here\
oh wait but the cameras face different\
the door looks the same\
and like this is like this is so crazy\
it's like perfect\
oh mines peeking out\
even the fire alarm\
the curtain the curtain is the one\
it's like mind boggling\
it's like peeking out\
wait mine's peeking out\
I thought it was covered\
I wonder what they're trying to like do\
something to do with the room I think \
do you think people laugh\
the topic that we're learning isn't bad it's just kind of a lot\
I don't remember acids and bases\
I have to study that\
yeah and oh the the last lecture was bad\
I need to study that\
autonomic\
do you like the afternoon class still\
everyone makes a joke that he's like whipped\
why does he come\
he just sits with you\
he doesn't have a class\
my mom just always jokes around saying oh how's his Korean going\
you considering that\
I mean it sounds cool \
I don't know\
bio or psych I feel\
bio or psych\
I hate writing\
you could do bio psych \
but bio's a lot too\
community health\
like what do you mean\
how many classes do you have to take to fulfill\
so like thirteen total\
my freshman year was rough\
second semester was fine\
oh my god\
just like you know\
oh yeah I do\
oh you only have to take one\
I'm sad I'm taking it over the summer\
you're just doing it\
I want to like get it over with\
don't you have to have like\
brushing some teeth\
I just want to be like at the dentists right now\
oh you think she was like bullied\
what's different\
but she walks past boys\
and she knows them\
I don't know\
the popular kids\
and I'm like what\
our school like did not have that dynamic\
I just did whatever I wanted to do\
Thing yeah\
we definitely had the popular kids and stuff\
I don't know it's just weird \
this like mirror thing\
in the criminal mind shows\
that's why I was so surprised I could see you\
Well I mean she said we could see each other through the glass\
wait so what is the psych study\
but like what does that show\
wait why are you taking psychology\
I really like psych\
you do\
it's like a really good field to find jobs\
not hate it but like I can't\
it's in mine\
the psych study \
during a psych study\
like the marshmallow kid\
our class is so small\
It wasn't that funny \
do you hear that\
they got chicken tenders\
so you're gonna go\
so after this you're gonna go straight to Dewick\
we're probably gonna go to the campus center\
the game starts at six thirty\
if it started at four I wouldn't be here\
oh yeah tell me\
he like freaked out and he called it off\
low key \
they went on a date did they kiss\
that's so strange\
who the hell knows\
yeah I know so then what happened\
he's like the male version of you\
maybe I'll like try\
have you guys been talking though still \
he was there\
yeah he was upset last night\
that you weren't there\
I think\
what happened he get kicked off the team\
I don't think he raced well\
there was a track meet yesterday\
track meet every saturday\
do you have nail polish remover\
I brought nail polish but no nail polish remover\
before we walked in here\
you should do peace games again\
we're not doing this again\
I don't know I didn't really\
okay maybe I will honestly\
one of the alums who I was talking with\
I sent her my resume\
I'm trying to get her help with other things\
what if this becomes like a viral YouTube video\
how did you meet\
why are they\
it's just random conversation\
what do you mean one of the dates\
wait wait wait\
the detective and like the woman \
they're talking in the most stereotypical voices\
at first I was like oh this is boring I don't like it\
war class for cuba\
what's the longest you've written\
they said towards the end it gets harder\
it'll probably get harder\
everyone else had already finished\
what did she even do\
I had to go up\
the computer that was like projected on the board\
how did she not have the instructions\
how long was it supposed to go\
where are our refreshments\
you totally have time\
I have fifteen minutes\
I have to decide what to do again for dinner tonight\
they like can make you pasta\
you don't like any of them\
not really\
do I have my phone can I use my phone\
then you can make like a PB and J or soemthing\
can I just look at the menu\
I wanted to be charging my phone\
sending what message\
those things are so scary\
I was literally sitting\
I know wait dude did I tell you how anxious I got about sending that message\
the state of Massachusetts\
just some girl \
we were like playing each other music videos and stuff it was funny\
that's so funny\
did I tell you I actually want her house\
she lives right at the bottom of the rainbow steps\
at least they have chargers on the bus now\
not supposed to load for like another twenty minutes\
scoot one to the left and then you're good\
also that bus ride took way too long\
it was like five hours\
supposed to be a two hour ride at max\
always have to like charge my phone and stuff\
plugged in my charger\
I caught up for that week\
oh my god\
you guys won\
I saw that there was riots\
I totally get getting into it\
no\
were you there for when\
who was talking about that\
What\'edd you do to get in jail\
Feels like I\'edm interrogating you\
This is weird\
What do you wanna talk about\
What are you doing this weekend\
I did not get what I wanted to get done\
And then today\'eds a busy day\
But yeah it\'eds just a crazy weekend\
Is cell bio hard\
Wait \
Like they\'edre literal\
But yeah \
Yeah so we\'edre in preparation\
Oh wow\
In the competitions and stuff twelve are allowed to dance\
We kind of do like rotation\
You\'edre gonna be judged on how you dance and like scored and stuff\
Professional teams there are literally people who do this for a living\
You know how you have like Indian cultural centers\
Gotcha\
Wait how many freshman are on the team\
Two of them are sophomores though\
So it\'eds five freshmen\
Do they still get more rank than you\
Compared to the newbies\
Just supposed to add color and brightness\
Combinatorial dances\
Sophomore dance senior dance junior dance\
Four main teams\
Very cultural at the same time\
Trusting your first instinct\
A lot of it was like\
Through Tufts\
Do what I did last summer\
I just like washed dishes\
Nice yeah something something to keep you busy\
That\'eds a good plan\
You\'edre doing like volume by rotation and you do subs and all that\
But it\'eds not an AP class\
You didn\'edt think about it\
Then you have to do it now\
It\'eds a prerequisite\
Oh okay\
There\'eds a lot of like statistical predictions\
If you know if you you know\
You need it\
wants to do bio psych now\
I didn\'edt necessarily go the full bio psych route\
So I\'edve been thinking about biotech\
That makes sense too\
All you really need is psych and social psych\
what do you wanna talk about\
I don't I don't know\
alright let's talk about let's talk about the NBA\
that's I'm still\
but like\
the players who are like old or like\
have like really bad contracts\
oh yeah remember when we had the blackout\
that was wild stuff\
that was for like a while\
that was for a while\
I remember the lab report was due at like two or three\
I was like freaking out that I wasn't gonna get the lab in\
honestly I'm kind of tired already\
I want it to be forties fifties\
so was so was the eclipse\
is that a thing\
I don't know\
what's that\
wait why are you taking econ\
I need it for IR\
damn\
are those the only two econ classes you gotta take\
I might take game theory too\
oh snap\
for the IR major like you have two required econs\
word\
damn\
have the olympics like started like do they do events today\
uh they started before that's what he said\
started after that\
events were going on\
it's like eleven hours ahead\
Korea's like eleven hours ahead\
they already have like events\
like yeah taped\
I don't know I kinda like it do you ski or snowboard or anything\
I mean I been I've skied I've boarded before\
I'm not like a big fan\
it's not to say I didn't watch\
how to get better form\
the poles yeah sure\
people say the pizza method and I'm like I don't know \
I don't even know how to do any of that \
I'm bad at skiing\
how do you stop on a snowboard then\
it's like the same thing so like it's like the same\
it's still hard but same same method kind of\
so like it's easier\
I kind of know how to like move\
some people don't use them\
if you're using like a selfie stick or a go pro\
you can turn without the sticks though\
I can see it\
fake news \
what do you you think you have to like\
imagine just being a researcher and listening to this\
man I don't know \
I don't either\
it's like especially if you have the SATs\
to us it didn't seem like anything\
like to us it seemd like oh they just made it not to fail \
do you have to like apply to your school \
take a test to get in\
I had to like apply and take a test\
well I didn't think it was that hard\
oh not the SSAT\
probably the same thing low key\
oh you do\
I watched it a little bit\
that's probably a better one to feel like\
except then at one point we all picked the same one and it was the wrong one\
he was so pissed\
moo\
it's usually like the second question\
it starts at three and the game's at three\
it's at three in the afternoon\
the game's at three and nine\
I've like seen people do it\
I was like wait\
it's at both\
it's the same amount of money\
and then go back and try it again\
we panicked\
but yeah\
he just says that every times he comes onto the screen\
cuz you're such an avid skier now\
I'm still recovering\
my mom is trying to like\
where do you wanna go for spring break\
I want somewhere warm\
I've known five people who've gotten it\
I don't know why that wasn't the first thing in my head\
my preschool teacher was riding a bike \
she was riding\
it was closed at one point so like everyone was turning around\
who's the guy that plays\
I should know the name\
you might be wondering why I've asked you here today\
but yeah\
right\
the screen is a window\
I have my interview\
my sister was also like really into\
we played all that together\
like straight up sixty bucks\
we just binged the entire thing in like two days\
the android detective guy\
the game gets shortened\
everything that has to do with him\
it might be because they're bankrupt\
that's so weird\
I don't know \
move it out of the way\
I know\
I have to go study later\
for psych\
I don't even know how I'm going to study\
I'm probably just gonna look at the practice test\
then say like okay\
and he doesn't curve it\
I'm just gonna accept\
Are you in the same class\
